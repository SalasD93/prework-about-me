      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student studying web development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I consider myself to be from Tampa, FL. However, I was born in Maryland.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to do anything. There hasn't been anything I have tried that I didn't like. I am very adaptable.
        Many of the things I enjoy doing involve the outdoors. Most of the time, it includes spending time with my son.
        We like to go to the beach, play outside, explore different areas, go kayaking, explore streams, go tubing, go to theme parks, go on nature trails,
        watch the stars outside, go for bike rides, play sports, to name some outdoor hobbies. When we are inside, we love to read books together, 
        paint, draw, build things with his blocks and play dough, do learning activities, cook, and he likes to help me on my computer, just to name a few.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is doing anything that involves helping people. I am hoping as I advance in a career involving innovative technology, 
        I will be able to eventually create some software that will enhance the lives of others.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Florida.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because it is a career that will accommodate my disabilities which will allow me to be self-sustaining. 
        This will give me the capability of providing a better life for my son and my family.</p>
